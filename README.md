# code-status

Check if any of your git projects needs attention:

Runs through all your code projects and checks the following:

- Is the repo on the master branch?
- Is the current branch ahead of the remote tracking branch?
- Is the repo dirty (i.e. does it contain changes that have not yet been
  checked in)
- Is there any untracked files in the repo?

If the answer is yes to any of those questions, this module will find
and list the projects.

sub-directories scanning for git projects.

- `--version` - show version
- `--simple` - make the output more simple for easy grepping
